# Webgl fundamentals

This project contains some notes, examples, and some experiments 
from (https://webglfundamentals.org)

I'm doing this because I discovered this super awesome shader editor
called kodelife. Which provides a very low barrier to entry for shader
and graphics programming. Something that I've always wanted to do
but never found a strightforward path into. Until now!
With my new web dev skills it seemed apropriate to try and learn
the very powerful and functional webgl.
With some c/c++ experience you should have no trouble getting into 
GLSL. Which I think is the most standard way to do graphics programming.
Which might be the language that webgl uses for shaders.
I mostly just want to make sure what I learn with kodelife can be 
transfered to webgl realitivly eaisly and vice versa, atleast the shader programming part.
Webgl will probablly require some web platform spacific set up.
Enough blabering. I'll actually take notes.
I mostly made this readme to keep track of that link lol
